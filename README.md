# SoundMuffler
Garry's Mod Sound Muffler, which lets you change the volume of individual sounds or just mute them
Inspired by the Minecraft Mod called "extreme sound muffler" on Curse-Forge

Adds the command ``soundmuffler`` for toggling the UI

Allows you to mute most Sounds or just multiply the Sound Volume (0-2)

Fully client-side, meaning it should work on all Servers
Right-Click on a Sound to bring up the option menu, letting you Mute it, adjust the multiplier or play a preview of the Sound
Switch between List Index or Recently played Sounds at the top
